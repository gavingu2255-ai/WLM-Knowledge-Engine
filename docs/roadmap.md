# Roadmap — WLM‑Knowledge‑Engine  
**From MVP → dimensional reasoning → causal knowledge graphs**

This roadmap outlines the evolution of WLM‑Knowledge‑Engine  
from a minimal deterministic extractor  
into a full structural knowledge system.

---

# Phase 1 — MVP (Current)
**Goal:** Establish a deterministic extraction pipeline.

### Deliverables
- entity extractor  
- dimension engine  
- graph builder  
- tension detector (stub)  
- closure predictor (stub)  
- CLI  
- documentation  

### Success Criteria
- deterministic knowledge graph generation  
- clean extension points  

---

# Phase 2 — Dimensional Reasoning
**Goal:** Add real spatial, temporal, physical, causal inference.**

### Deliverables
- verb‑based relation extraction  
- causal link detection  
- temporal ordering  
- spatial topology inference  
- physical constraint inference  

### Success Criteria
- knowledge graphs become meaningfully structured  
- contradictions detectable  

---

# Phase 3 — Causal Graph Construction
**Goal:** Build full causal knowledge graphs.**

### Deliverables
- causal propagation  
- multi‑step inference  
- causal closure prediction  
- causal tension detection  

### Success Criteria
- multi‑hop reasoning  
- causal consistency  

---

# Phase 4 — Multi‑Document Knowledge Fusion
**Goal:** Merge knowledge across documents.**

### Deliverables
- entity alignment  
- relation merging  
- contradiction resolution  
- cross‑document closures  

### Success Criteria
- stable, global knowledge graphs  

---

# Phase 5 — Real‑Time Knowledge Runtime
**Goal:** Update knowledge graphs dynamically from streaming text.**

### Deliverables
- incremental extraction  
- real‑time contradiction detection  
- real‑time closure propagation  

### Success Criteria
- <50ms updates  
- stable knowledge under change  

---

# Summary

WLM‑Knowledge‑Engine evolves through:

1. MVP — deterministic extraction  
2. Dimensional reasoning  
3. Causal graph construction  
4. Multi‑document fusion  
5. Real‑time knowledge runtime  

This transforms WLM from **structured cognition**  
into **structured knowledge**.
